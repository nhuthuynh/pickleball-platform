# LESSONS

Running log of mistakes made and how they were fixed, so later phases don't
repeat them. Append, don't rewrite history — each entry is a small postmortem.

## T0 — Bootstrap

- **Mistake:** the session was originally briefed to "resume" an in-progress Go
  backend, but the repository actually contained an unrelated TypeScript
  sample project with none of the described docs or code. Proceeding as if the
  briefing's assumed state existed would have silently fabricated locked
  decisions and history that were never actually agreed.
  **Fix:** stopped and asked the user before writing anything; confirmed this
  is a genuine from-scratch bootstrap using uploaded planning docs as the
  source of truth, and got explicit sign-off to remove the unrelated project
  rather than leaving it alongside the Go code.
- **Mistake to avoid going forward:** `internal/gen/**` (buf/sqlc output) is
  gitignored per the design, so adapters that import it will not compile in
  any environment without `buf`/`sqlc` installed. Don't treat "doesn't compile
  standalone" as a regression in adapter code — `make test-domain` (domain +
  app only, zero external deps) is the correct green bar for T0, not a full
  `go build ./...`.
